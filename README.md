# Maps
Apache Cordova, JavaScript, jQuery, gmaps3

School project. It lets you draw simple routes on Google map. There was a server-side code in C# that stored trips (routes) on the
school server. Unfortunately my school account was shut after graduation and I didn't backup that code so this functionality is dead.

In root directory there is an .apk file- ready to install.
